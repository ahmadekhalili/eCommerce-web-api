1-  DateTimeField fields are based on operation system time(operation system local time should set correctly)
2- neghative ids must not be in objects  ids saved in database (reserved by method like: main/widgets/product_category_widget  as blank)
3- product filters limited to 50
4- front must send 'sabad' products ids and favoriets in cookie by this way: 'products_ids': "1,2,3,4"      and    'favorite_products_ids': "1,2,3"  (accurding to cart.cart.Cart.__init__)
5- for installing new version of django/rest_Framework you should consider translations! (you can see traslations video)
6- dont copy django project if did at least remove db and all migrations (for example user sessions dont works)
